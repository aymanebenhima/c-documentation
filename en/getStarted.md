# Getting Started with C Programming

Welcome to your first steps in C programming! In this chapter, we'll get you set up and ready to write your first C program using an online compiler. Let’s dive in!

## Why Start with an Online Compiler?

An online compiler is an excellent choice for beginners:
- **Ease of Use**: No installation required—just open your browser and start coding.
- **Accessibility**: Access your code from anywhere, anytime.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Quickly see the results of your code to help with learning and debugging.

We will use the [Programiz Online C Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/) for this tutorial. It's user-friendly and perfect for getting started with C.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Using the Programiz Online Compiler

### 1. Access the Online Compiler

Open your web browser and navigate to the [Programiz Online C Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/).

### 2. Write Your First C Program

You’ll see a default template in the editor. Let’s replace it with our own code. Type or paste the following C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
Here’s what each part of the code does:
- **#include <stdio.h>**: Includes the Standard Input Output library to use the printf function.
- **int main() { ... }**: The main function where execution begins.
- **printf("Hello, World!\n");**: Prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- **return 0;**: Ends the program successfully.

### 3. Run Your Code

Click the "Run" button below the editor to execute your program. The output will appear in the console section below the code editor. You should see:

```text	
Hello, World!
```

### 4. Explore Features of the Programiz Compiler

- **Save Your Code**: Click the "Save" button to save your code. You'll get a unique URL that you can bookmark or share.
- **Load Examples**: Use the "Examples" button to see sample programs and learn different concepts.
- **Share and Embed**: Share your code with others or embed it in websites using the provided links.

### 5. Debugging and Enhancing Your Code

The Programiz compiler also includes basic debugging tools:

- **Set Breakpoints**: Click on the line number to set breakpoints and debug your code.
- **Step Through**: Use the step-through functionality to execute your code line-by-line and inspect variables.
- **Next Steps**: Exploring C Programming

Congratulations on writing and running your first C program! You’re now ready to dive deeper into C programming. In the upcoming chapters, we'll cover:

- **Basic Syntax**: Learn the fundamental building blocks of C programming.
- **Output**: Understand how to display data using printf.
- **Comments**: Add comments to your code to make it more readable.
